1.1 THE VALUE OF INFORMATION

Consider these three business scenarios.

SCENARIO 1

A toy manufacturer gets an order for 5,000 wagons. It needs 20,000 wheels to produce them. It has only 4,000 wheels in stock. It must order at least 16,000 more wheels.

Possible Outcome A
The production control manager phones the purchasing agent who handles wheels. She’s out for the rest of the day, so the production control manager leaves a voice mail. When the purchasing agent returns the call the next morning, the production control manager is on the factory foor, so she leaves a voice mail. They talk the day after that. The purchasing agent then calls three suppliers from whom the toy manufacturer has bought wheels in the past. A is no longer in business. B’s sales representative has just left on a three-week vacation. She leaves a voice mail for C’s salesperson. The salesperson senses desperation in the purchasing agent’s message and quotes a price that is 25% higher than usual. C gets the order anyhow.

Possible Outcome B
The toy company’s production planning system calculates the need and sends an electronic message to the purchasing department. Workfow software in the purchasing department routes the request to the purchasing agent, but will reroute it to her manager if she doesn’t process it within 24 hours. She processes it the next morning, sending electronic Request for Bid messages to three frms that have supplied wheels in the past. She gets bids back from the two that are still in business. C quotes standard prices. B, whose sales rep is eager to close some business before leaving on a three-week vacation, offers a 20% discount. This time, B gets the order.

SCENARIO 2
A college professor enjoys solving puzzles and often buys puzzle books online. Two bookstores get a new puzzle book edited by Will Shortz, who is known for high-quality puzzles.

Possible Outcome A
Seller A prices the books at a discount to attract business. It puts them on a shelf and its web site, and waits for people to walk in and buy them or to order them online. Some do, but the professor doesn’t happen to visit the store or its site, so she doesn’t see it.

Possible Outcome B
Seller B keeps a list of people who have ordered books online in the past, indexed by category. It sends people who bought puzzle books an email to inform them of the new book. The professor orders the book from the store that sent her the email. She doesn’t feel like taking time to check other sources, so she doesn’t know the other store would sell it for $2 less.

SCENARIO 3
An athletic equipment store sells light-weight, impact-absorbing running socks for $10 per pair, of which $3.50 is its proft margin. The store’s owner fgures that many people who buy running shoes could also use a pair of those socks, so he plans a sock promotion to tie in with shoe sales.

Possible Outcome A
The store offers running shoe buyers a coupon for $3 off a pair of these socks. Sock sales go up a lot. The manager decides to include a $3 sock coupon with every pair of running shoes they sell.

Possible Outcome B
The store tries three one-week experiments: coupons for $1, $2, and $3 off a pair of these socks. They plot sock sales as in Figure 1.1(a). They know sales volume is not their objective: they sell more socks with higher discounts, but they also make less proft per pair. They graph proft on socks as in Figure 1.1(b). Based on this information, the manager decides to include a $2 discount coupon with every pair of running shoes.


WHAT THIS MEANS
Think about these outcomes. In each scenario, which business will do better? The person or organization that uses information effectively is more likely to come out ahead. Information can be more important than product features: a product with less capability or a higher price can outsell a better one, if prospective buyers know what it can do and how it can be used.

These three scenarios illustrate the three main ways that information and information systems help companies succeed: linking parts of an organization, connecting organizations to customers and suppliers, and helping make better decisions. A chapter is devoted to each of these key concepts later in this book.

EFFECTIVENESS VERSUS EFFICIENCY
You just read that businesses should use information effectively. You’ve also heard people talk about effciency. A businessperson must know the difference.
Effectiveness describes how well you achieve your objective. To measure effectiveness, you must know what that objective is.
Effciency describes how much output you get from each unit of input. To measure effciency, you must be able to measure input and output.
Example: You must choose between two software packages to prepare your income tax return. One is diffcult to use, with complicated data entry procedures that must be followed precisely, and it can’t prepare your state return. However, it is very effcient: it runs quickly on your old, slow computer. The other has a much more modern interface, and can prepare returns for any U.S. state, so it gets the job done more effectively—but it runs slowly on your computer. It is ineffcient. You would need to upgrade your computer or spend a lot of time waiting for it to complete its calculations. You must know your objectives and tradeoffs before choosing.

Why does this matter? With information systems, you are concerned with both effectiveness and effciency. Ideally, you want both. However, there are often tradeoffs between them. Their relative importance can vary from one situation to the next. You must understand the difference between the two concepts to make those tradeoffs properly.

Where you fit in: These tradeoffs are business decisions. They shouldn’t be made on technical grounds. Technical factors are involved, but the fnal decision must be made by businesspeople such as you’ll be after you graduate.
