Your use of IT makes you part of the most connected generation in history: You have grown up online; you are, quite literally, never out of touch; you use more information technologies (in the form of digital devices), for more tasks, and are bombarded with more information, than any generation in history. The MIT Technology Review refers to you as Homo conexus. Information technologies are so deeply embedded in your lives that your daily routines would be almost unrecognizable to a student just 20 years ago.

Essentially, you practise continuous computing, surrounded by a movable information network. This network is created by constant co-operation among the digital devices you carry (for example, laptops, tablets, and smartphones); the wired and wireless networks that you access as you move about; and Web-based tools for finding information and communicating and collaborating with other people. Your network enables you to pull information about virtually anything from anywhere, at any time, and to push your own ideas back to the Web, from wherever you are, via a mobile device. Think of everything you do online, often with your smartphone: register for classes; take classes (and not just at your university); access class syllabi, information, PowerPoints, and lectures; research class papers and presentations; conduct banking; pay your bills; research, shop, and purchase products from companies and other people; sell your “stuff”; search for, and apply for, jobs; make your travel reservations (hotel, airline, rental car); create your own blog and post your own podcasts and videos to it; design your own page on Facebook and LinkedIn; make and upload videos to YouTube; take, edit, and print your own digital photographs; stream music and movies to your personal libraries; use RSS feeds to create your personal electronic newspaper; text and tweet your friends and family throughout your
day; send Snaps; order a ride from Uber; select a place or room to rent on Airbnb; and many other activities. (Note: If any of these terms are unfamiliar to you, don’t worry. You will learn about everything mentioned here in detail later in this text.)

Let’s put the preceding paragraph in perspective. What would a typical day for you be like if you had no access to computing devices of any kind, including your phone?

The Informed User—You!
So, the question is: Why you should learn about information systems and information technology? After all, you can comfortably use a computer (or other electronic devices) to perform many activities, you have been surfing the Web for years, and you feel confident that you can manage any IT application that your organization’s Management Information Systems (MIS) department installs. Let’s look at three reasons why you should learn about ISs and IT.4 CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Information Systems

The first reason to learn about information systems and information technology is to become an informed user; that is, a person knowledgeable about ISs and IT. In general, informed users obtain greater value from whichever technologies they use. You will enjoy many benefits from being an informed user of IT, including:
• You will benefit more from your organization’s IT applications because you will understand what is “behind” those applications (see Figure 1.1). That is, what you see on your computer screen is brought to you by your MIS department, who are operating “behind” your screen.
• You will be in a position to enhance the quality of your organization’s IT applications with your input.
• Even as a new graduate, you will quickly be in a position to recommend—and perhaps to help select—which IT applications your organization will use.
• Being an informed user will keep you abreast of both new information technologies andrapid developments in existing technologies. Remaining “on top of things” will help you toanticipate the impacts that “new and improved” technologies will have on your organization and to make recommendations regarding the adoption and use of these technologies.
• You will understand how using IT can improve your organization’s performance and teamwork as well as your own productivity.
• If you have ideas of becoming an entrepreneur, then being an informed user will help you to utilize IT when you start your own business.

The second reason to learn about ISs and IT is that the organization you join will undoubtedly be undergoing a digital transformation. In fact, digital transformation has become one of the most important strategies for organizations. The Data Warehousing Institute (www.tdwi.org) predicted that by the end of 2017, approximately two-thirds of CEOs of the Forbes Global 2000 companies would have digital transformation at the centre of their corporate strategy. (The Global 2000 is a list of the 2,000 largest public companies in the world, ranked by Forbes magazine.)

Digital transformation is the business strategy that leverages IT to dramatically improve
employee, customer, and business partner relationships; to support continuous improvement
in business operations and business processes; and to develop new business models and businesses. The information technologies that drive digital transformation include:
• Big Data (see Chapter 5)
• Business analytics (see Chapter 12)
• Social computing (see Chapter 9)
• Mobile computing (see Chapter 8)
• The Internet of Things (see Chapter 8)
• Agile systems development methods (see Chapter 13)
• Cloud computing (see Technology Guide 3)
• Artificial intelligence (see Technology Guide 4)

The third reason to learn about ISs and IT is that managing the IS function within an organization is no longer the exclusive responsibility of the IS department. Rather, users now play key roles in every step of this process. The overall objective in this text is to provide you with the necessary information to contribute immediately to managing the IS function in your organization. In short, our goal is to help you become a very informed user!

IT Offers Career Opportunities
Because IT is vital to the operation of modern businesses, it offers many employment opportunities. The demand for traditional IT staff—programmers, business analysts, systems analysts, and designers—is substantial. In addition, many well-paid jobs exist in areas such as the Internet and electronic commerce (e-commerce), mobile commerce (m-commerce), network security, telecommunications, and multimedia design.

Managing Information Resources
Managing information systems in modern organizations is a difficult, complex task. Several factors contribute to this complexity. First, information systems have enormous strategic value to organizations. Firms rely on them so heavily that, in some cases, when these systems are not working (even for a short time), the firm cannot function. (This situation is called “being hostage to information systems.”) Second, information systems are very expensive to acquire, operate, and maintain.

A third factor contributing to the difficulty in managing information systems is the evolution of the management information systems (MIS) function within the organization. When businesses first began to use computers in the early 1950s, the MIS department “owned” the only computing resource in the organization, the mainframe. At that time, end users did not interact directly with the mainframe.

In contrast, in the modern organization, computers are located in all departments, and almost all employees use computers in their work. This situation, known as end-user computing, has led to a partnership between the MIS department and the end users. The MIS department now acts as more of a consultant to end users, viewing them as customers. In fact, the main function of the MIS department is to use IT to solve end-users’ business problems.

As a result of these developments, the responsibility for managing information resources is now divided between the MIS department and the end users. This arrangement raises several important questions: Which resources are managed by whom? What is the role of the MIS department, its structure, and its place within the organization? What is the appropriate relationship between the MIS department and the end users? Regardless of who is doing what, it is essential that the MIS department and the end users work in close co-operation.

There is no standard way to divide responsibility for developing and maintaining information resources between the MIS department and the end users. Instead, that division depends on several factors: the size and nature of the organization, the amount and type of IT resources, the organization’s attitudes toward computing, the attitudes of top management toward computing, the maturity level of the technology, the amount and nature of outsourced IT work, and even the countries in which the company operates. Generally speaking, the MIS department is responsible for corporate-level and shared resources, and the end users are responsible for departmental resources. Table 1.2 identifies both the traditional functions and various new, consultative functions of the MIS department.
